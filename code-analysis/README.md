# About

Tooling for analyzing source code or compiled code (project specific) to discover security API access tracing through the code.

The basic code analysis for different languages must be supported by a corresponding [security usage inventory](../security-usage-inventory/README.md).  Some API frameworks on top of languages are significant to require their own analysis tooling, for example highly dynamic ones like Python's Flask or Java's Sprint Framework.
