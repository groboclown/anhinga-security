# Data Store Schema

Anhinga's tooling breaks down operation into small, independent parts.  Each of these outputs results in a JSon-like structure that follows a strict schema.

The schema follows the [JSon Schema standard](https://json-schema.org/).  They are written here in Yaml to allow for easy commenting and formatting.  Each top-level schema definition must be an object.
